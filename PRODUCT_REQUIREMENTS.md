# Product Requirements Document: AI Social Media Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered social media agent. The agent will automate the process of creating and publishing content to Facebook and Instagram, with the goal of increasing audience engagement.

### 1.1. Project Goal

To develop an AI agent that autonomously generates engaging social media posts (text and images) based on a given topic, and learns from post performance to optimize future content.

### 1.2. Target Audience

Content creators, marketers, and businesses looking to automate their social media presence and increase engagement.

## 2. User Stories

- **As a user, I want to...** provide a topic to the AI agent so that it can generate relevant content.
- **As a user, I want to...** have the AI agent create a complete post, including an engaging caption and a relevant image.
- **As a user, I want to...** have the AI agent automatically publish the generated post to my Facebook Page and Instagram account.
- **As a user, I want to...** have the AI agent track the engagement of each post (likes, comments, shares).
- **As a user, I want to...** have the AI agent learn from engagement data to create more effective content over time.

## 3. Features (Iterative Development Plan)

We will build this project iteratively. Each of the following features represents a milestone.

### Milestone 1: Core Application Setup (Current Stage)

- **Objective:** Establish the foundational structure of the Flask application.
- **Key Results:**
    - Set up a basic Flask application.
    - Initialize a SQLite database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
    - Create a `.env` file for managing secrets.

### Milestone 2: AI Agent & Content Generation

- **Objective:** Implement the core AI logic for generating post content.
- **Key Results:**
    - Create a Pydantic model for the desired post structure (e.g., `caption`, `image_prompt`).
    - Use `pydantic-ai` and the Gemini API to generate a post based on a topic.
    - Integrate an image generation API to create an image based on the AI's prompt.

### Milestone 3: Social Media Integration

- **Objective:** Connect the application to Facebook and Instagram.
- **Key Results:**
    - Use the `facebook-sdk` to post to a Facebook Page.
    - Use the Instagram Graph API to post to an Instagram account.
    - Store API credentials securely.

### Milestone 4: Asynchronous Task Execution

- **Objective:** Prevent blocking requests by running long-running tasks in the background.
- **Key Results:**
    - Configure Celery and Redis.
    - Offload AI content generation and social media posting to Celery tasks.

### Milestone 5: Learning & Adaptation

- **Objective:** Implement the 'learning' functionality of the agent.
- **Key Results:**
    - Create a mechanism to fetch post engagement data from the Facebook/Instagram APIs.
    - Store engagement data in the database.
    - Enhance the AI's prompt to include context from past successful posts, allowing it to 'learn'.

## 4. Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Database:** SQLite (for now), potentially migrating to PostgreSQL.
- **AI Engine:** `pydantic-ai` with Google's Gemini Pro.
- **Image Generation:** A suitable image generation API (e.g., DALL-E 3, Midjourney, or an open-source alternative).
- **Social Media Integration:** `facebook-sdk` for the Facebook and Instagram Graph APIs.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery with Redis.
- **Secrets Management:** `python-dotenv` and a `.env` file.
